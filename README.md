# OCR (Optical Character Recognision)
Making an app to turn a photo into a text using the ocr transformations. 

Specifically aimed towards an implementation in accountingsoftware. Invoices received on paper can easily translated in their digital equivalent, extracting only the important information (such as the date of payment, the total price, name of company, VAT (aka BTW in dutch speaking countries) number, ...).


## Used tech
* open-cv: preprocessing the image
* Tesseract (pytesseract): doing the actual ocr stuff
* android studio: framework for the app
